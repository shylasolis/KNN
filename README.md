# Supervised Neighbors-Based Learning 

This will be my very first implemention of an independent project in Github. As I continue through Gitbhub exploring I hope to become more and more familiar with my surroundings to share my independent projects. Most of my projects will lean towards machine learning and then soon deep learning. 


* Classification Algorithm (discrete labels)
* Regression (continuous labels)
* K "User define constant" (k-nn learning or radius-based learning)
* K-NN learning methods remember all of its training data, this is known as non-generalizing
* Non-parametric
* Lazy
* Approach for size of data: use brute force approach if sample size N and dimensions D is not too large. If N is too large, use KD-tree.If N is large and D>=20 use Ball tree for more detailed information refer to: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#ball-tree 
* Aplications: handwritten digits and satellite image scenes
* Hypothesis class:
